# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis
I used Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets for Instacart. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
# Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
 # Data
 The Dataset contains orders, orders_products_prior, products, customers, departments data details of the Instacart Grocery.
 # Tools
 The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
 - Pandas: for data analysis
 - Numpy: for mathematical equations
 - SciPy: for mathematical equations
 - Seaborn: for data visualizations
 - Matplotlib: for data visualizations
# Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- 01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.
- 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- 4 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
